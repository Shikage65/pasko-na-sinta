        <p id="maryan"> Look how far you've traveled now, every step you're making is one step closer to your dreams. <br>
          If you're feeling down, and want to give up, when things are piling up and you can bear it no more,<br>
          Always remember there are people silently rooting for you, believing in you.<br>
          Yesterday, we were just children, giving no care to the world,<br>
          But as time passes by, burdens on our shoulders make our knees bend.<br>
          Don't be afraid when you think you can't move forward any further.<br>
          Just take a deep breath and remember why you started.<br>
          Take that diploma! But don't let it cost you your smile.
