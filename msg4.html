        <h1 class="header_text">I'm Proud of you! <br>Keep Moving Forward!</h1>
        <p id="maryan">Kamusta ka na? First of all I'm sorry for blocking you, that's so dumb of me. Honestly I don't know kung bakit ko rin ginawa yon eh haha.
          Please know that I'm always thinking of you, ikaw pa rin walang iba. Ginayuma mo ba ko? Jk. We're getting closer to our dreams. Malapit nang mag 2025, I'm still waiting for that coffee date.
          I'm proud of your achievements! Nandito lang ako palagi, silently rooting for you, lagi akong nasa side mo(kahit illegal pa yan). It's my fault why our
          story can't move forward, bakit ba ang tanga ko? Ngayon ko na-realize how much you want me to do something, to exert effort. I hope when this message reach you, it's 
          not too late. Gusto kong mag-grow kasama ka, can I court you? It's almost 2 years since senior high school, a lot of things has changed but what I felt for you since then hasn't.
           Again I'm sorry for causing you pain and not being there sa mga breakdowns mo, sa paggawa mo ng school works, sa mga panahong kailangan mo ng kasama, kailangan mo ng 
          makikinig sayo. Sana hindi mo isiping this is guilt speaking, this is me talking, trying to make things right. Whether we like it or not, the new year is fast approaching, isang bagong
          taon na naman. Natatanggal angas ko pagdating sayo eh. I'm always looking at the moon and stars everynight, listening to walang kamatayang Cup of Joe,
          Maki, at Ben&Ben while thinking of you. I wish you the best! Merry Christmas sayo, keep that beautiful smile of yours, be proud of yourself and to everything that you accomplished this 
          year! Padayon lang, future CPA!
